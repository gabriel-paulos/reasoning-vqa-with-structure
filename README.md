# reasoning-vqa-with-structure
Make the VLM use scene graph and entailment tree to reason about events in a VQA using grounded and interpretable reasoning chains. 

The main model used will be LLaMa 3.

## TODO

run the prompts over NExT-QA and IntentQA and maybe EgoSchema to test how well it does.
